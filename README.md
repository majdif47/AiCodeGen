# 🧠 AI Code Generator 🖥️

Welcome to AiCodeGen, where a new AI-generated code snippet is added daily. Witness the fun and chaos as AI creates everything from garbage code to surprisingly  decent snippets.🤔 

---

## 🌟 Features

- 🎲 **Random Language Selection**: Generates code snippets in Go, Rust, Python, or JavaScript.  
- ✨ **Dynamic File Management**: Saves each snippet in a file with the proper extensions.  
- 🤖 **AI Integration**: Uses AI models to create garbage/nonsensical/lame to half-decent code (results may vary).  
- 🔄 **Automated Git Workflow**: Adds, commits, and pushes changes to your GitHub repository.

## 🚀 How It Works


1. 🧑‍💻 Runs the Go program.
2. 📂 Generates and saves random code.
3. 📝 Commits and pushes it to the repo.

## 🌟 Example Output

- **Snippet Content**:
  ```javascript
  // Example AI-generated JavaScript code
  function add(a, b) {
      return a + b;
  }
  console.log(add(2, 3));
